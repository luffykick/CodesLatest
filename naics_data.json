        "description": "The Sector as a Whole\n\nThe Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in growing crops, raising animals, harvesting timber, and harvesting fish and other animals from a farm, ranch, or their natural habitats.\n\nThe establishments in this sector are often described as farms, ranches, dairies, greenhouses, nurseries, orchards, or hatcheries.  A farm may consist of a single tract of land or a number of separate tracts which may be held under different tenures.  For example, one tract may be owned by the farm operator and another rented.  It may be operated by the operator alone or with the assistance of members of the household or hired employees, or it may be operated by a partnership, corporation, or other type of organization. When a landowner has one or more tenants, renters, croppers, or managers, the land operated by each is considered a farm.\n\nThe sector distinguishes two basic activities: agricultural production and agricultural support activities.  Agricultural production includes establishments performing the complete farm or ranch operation, such as farm owner-operators and tenant farm operators.  Agricultural support activities include establishments that perform one or more activities associated with farm operation, such as soil preparation, planting, harvesting, and management, on a contract or fee basis.\n\nExcluded from the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting sector are establishments primarily engaged in agricultural research (e.g., experimental farms) and government establishments primarily engaged in administering programs for regulating and conserving land, mineral, wildlife, and forest use.  These establishments are classified in Industry 54171, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences; and Industry 92412, Administration of Conservation Programs, respectively.",

                "description": "Industries in the Crop Production subsector grow crops mainly for food and fiber.  The subsector comprises establishments, such as farms, orchards, groves, greenhouses, and nurseries, primarily engaged in growing crops, plants, vines, or trees and their seeds.\n\nThe industries in this subsector are grouped by similarity of production activity, including biological and physiological characteristics and economic requirements, the length of growing season, degree of crop rotation, extent of input specialization, labor requirements, and capital demands.  The production process is typically completed when the raw product or commodity grown reaches the \"farm gate\" for market, that is, at the point of first sale or price determination.\n\nEstablishments are classified in the Crop Production subsector when crop production (i.e., value of crops for market) accounts for one-half or more of the establishment's total agricultural production.  Within the subsector, establishments are classified in a specific industry when a product or industry family of products (i.e., oilseed and grain farming, vegetable and melon farming, fruit and tree nut farming) account for one-half or more of the establishment's agricultural production.  Establishments with one-half or more crop production with no one product or family of products of an industry accounting for one-half of the establishment's agricultural production are treated as general combination crop farming and are classified in Industry 11199, All Other Crop Farming.\n\nIndustries in the Crop Production subsector include establishments that own, operate, and manage and those that operate and manage.  Those that manage only are classified in Subsector 115, Support Activities for Agriculture and Forestry.  Establishments that raise aquatic plants in controlled or selected aquatic environments are classified in Subsector 112, Animal Production and Aquaculture.",

The subsector includes establishments, such as ranches, farms, and feedlots, primarily engaged in keeping, grazing, breeding, or feeding animals.  These animals are kept for the products they produce or for eventual sale.  The animals are generally raised in various environments, from total confinement or captivity to feeding on an open range pasture.\n\nThe industries in this subsector are grouped by important factors, such as suitable grazing or pasture land, specialized buildings, type of equipment, and the amount and types of labor required.  Establishments are classified in the Animal Production and Aquaculture subsector when animal production (i.e., value of animals for market) accounts for one-half or more of the establishment's total agricultural production.  Establishments with one-half or more animal production with no one animal product or family of animal products of an industry accounting for one-half of the establishment's agricultural production are treated as combination animal farming classified in Industry 11299, All Other Animal Production.",

                "description": "Industries in the Forestry and Logging subsector grow and harvest timber on a long production cycle (i.e., of 10 years or more).  Long production cycles use different production processes than short production cycles, which require more horticultural interventions prior to harvest, resulting in processes more similar to those found in the Crop Production subsector.  Consequently, Christmas tree production and other production involving production cycles of less than 10 years, are classified in the Crop Production subsector.\n\nIndustries in this subsector specialize in different stages of the production cycle.  Reforestation requires production of seedlings in specialized nurseries.  Timber production requires natural forest or suitable areas of land that are available for a long duration.  The maturation time for timber depends upon the species of tree, the climatic conditions of the region, and the intended purpose of the timber.  The harvesting of timber (except when done on an extremely small scale) requires specialized machinery unique to the industry.  Establishments gathering forest products, such as gums, barks, balsam needles, rhizomes, fibers, Spanish moss, and ginseng and truffles, are also included in this subsector.",

        "description": "The Sector as a Whole\n\nThe Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector comprises establishments that extract naturally occurring mineral solids, such as coal and ores; liquid minerals, such as crude petroleum; and gases, such as natural gas.  The term \"mining\" is used in the broad sense to include quarrying, well operations, beneficiating (e.g., crushing, screening, washing, and flotation), and other preparation customarily performed at the mine site, or as a part of mining activity.\n\nThe Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector distinguishes two basic activities: mine operation and mining support activities.  Mine operation includes establishments operating mines, quarries, or oil and gas wells on their own account or for others on a contract or fee basis.  Mining support activities include establishments that perform exploration (except geophysical surveying and mapping) on a contract or fee basis and/or other mining services on a contract or fee basis (except mine site preparation, construction, and transportation activities).\n\nEstablishments in the Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector are grouped and classified according to the natural resource mined or to be mined.  Industries include establishments that develop and/or operate the mine site, extract the natural resources, beneficiate (i.e., prepare) the mineral mined, or provide mining support activities.  Beneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to particles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use.  The operations that take place in beneficiation are primarily mechanical, such as grinding, washing, magnetic separation, and centrifugal separation.  In contrast, manufacturing operations primarily use chemical and electrochemical processes, such as electrolysis and distillation.  However, some treatments, such as heat treatments, take place in both the beneficiation and the manufacturing (i.e., smelting/refining) stages.  The range of preparation activities varies by mineral and the purity of any given ore deposit.  While some minerals, such as petroleum and natural gas, require little or no preparation, others are washed and screened, while yet others, such as gold and silver, can be transformed into bullion before leaving the mine site.\n\nMining, beneficiating, and manufacturing activities often occur in a single location.  Separate receipts will be collected for these activities whenever possible.  When receipts cannot be broken out between mining and manufacturing, establishments that mine or quarry nonmetallic minerals, and then beneficiate the nonmetallic minerals into more finished manufactured products are classified based on the primary activity of the establishment.  A mine that manufactures a small amount of finished products will be classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction.  An establishment that mines whose primary output is a more finished manufactured product will be classified in Sector 31-33, Manufacturing.",

                "description": "Industries in the Mining (except Oil and Gas) subsector primarily engage in mining, mine site development, and beneficiating (i.e., preparing) metallic minerals and nonmetallic minerals, including coal.  The term \"mining\" is used in the broad sense to include ore extraction, quarrying, and beneficiating (e.g., crushing, screening, washing, sizing, concentrating, and flotation), customarily done at the mine site.\n\nBeneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to particles which can be separated into mineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use.  The operations that take place in beneficiation are primarily mechanical, such as grinding, washing, magnetic separation, centrifugal separation, and so on. In contrast, manufacturing operations primarily use chemical and electrochemical processes, such as electrolysis, distillation, and so on.  However, some treatments, such as heat treatments, take place in both stages: the beneficiation and the manufacturing (i.e., smelting/refining) stages.  The range of preparation activities varies by mineral and the purity of any given ore deposit.  While some minerals, such as petroleum and natural gas, require little or no preparation, others are washed and screened, while yet others, such as gold and silver, can be transformed into bullion before leaving the mine site.\n\nEstablishments in the Mining (except Oil and Gas) subsector include those that have complete responsibility for operating mines and quarries (except oil and gas wells) and those that operate mines and quarries (except oil and gas wells) for others on a contract or fee basis.  Establishments primarily engaged in providing support services, on a contract or fee basis (except geophysical surveying and mapping, mine site preparation, construction, and transportation activities), required for the mining and quarrying of minerals are classified in Subsector 213, Support Activities for Mining.",

        "description": "The Sector as a Whole\n\nThe Construction sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in the construction of buildings or engineering projects (e.g., highways and utility systems).  Establishments primarily engaged in the preparation of sites for new construction and establishments primarily engaged in subdividing land for sale as building sites also are included in this sector.\n\nConstruction work done may include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs.  Activities of these establishments generally are managed at a fixed place of business, but they usually perform construction activities at multiple project sites.  Production responsibilities for establishments in this sector are usually specified in (1) contracts with the owners of construction projects (prime contracts) or (2) contracts with other construction establishments (subcontracts).\n\nEstablishments primarily engaged in contracts that include responsibility for all aspects of individual construction projects are commonly known as general contractors, but also may be known as design-builders, construction managers, turnkey contractors, or (in cases where two or more establishments jointly secure a general contract) joint-venture contractors.  Construction managers that provide oversight and scheduling only (i.e., agency) as well as construction managers that are responsible for the entire project (i.e., at risk) are included as general contractor type establishments.  Establishments of the \"general contractor type\" frequently arrange construction of separate parts of their projects through subcontracts with other construction establishments.\n\nEstablishments primarily engaged in activities to produce a specific component (e.g., masonry, painting, and electrical work) of a construction project are commonly known as specialty trade contractors.  Activities of specialty trade contractors are usually subcontracted from other construction establishments, but especially in remodeling and repair construction, the work may be done directly for the owner of the property.\n\nEstablishments primarily engaged in activities to construct buildings to be sold on sites that they own are known as for-sale builders, but also may be known as speculative builders or merchant builders.  For-sale builders produce buildings in a manner similar to general contractors, but their production processes also include site acquisition and securing of financial backing.  For-sale builders are most often associated with the construction of residential buildings.  Like general contractors, they may subcontract all or part of the actual construction work on their buildings.\n\nThere are substantial differences in the types of equipment, work force skills, and other inputs required by establishments in this sector.  To highlight these differences and variations in the underlying production functions, this sector is divided into three subsectors.\n\nSubsector 236, Construction of Buildings, comprises establishments of the general contractor type and for-sale builders involved in the construction of buildings.  Subsector 237, Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, comprises establishments involved in the construction of engineering projects.  Subsector 238, Specialty Trade Contractors, comprises establishments engaged in specialty trade activities generally needed in the construction of all types of buildings.\n\nForce account construction is construction work performed by an enterprise primarily engaged in some business other than construction for its own account, using employees of the enterprise.  This activity is not included in the construction sector unless the construction work performed is the primary activity of a separate establishment of the enterprise.  The installation and the ongoing repair and maintenance of telecommunications and utility networks is excluded from construction when the establishments performing the work are not independent contractors.  Although a growing proportion of this work is subcontracted to independent contractors in the Construction sector, the operating units of telecommunications and utility companies performing this work are included with the telecommunications or utility activities.",

Part or all of the production work for which the establishments in this subsector have responsibility may be subcontracted to other construction establishments--usually specialty trade contractors.\n\nEstablishments in this subsector are classified based on the types of buildings they construct.  This classification reflects variations in the requirements of the underlying production processes.",

The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. \n\nSpecialty trade activities are classified in this subsector if the skills and equipment present are specific to heavy or civil engineering construction projects.  For example, specialized equipment is needed to paint lines on highways.  This equipment is not normally used in building applications so the activity is classified in this subsector.  Traffic signal installation, while specific to highways, uses much of the same skills and equipment that are needed for electrical work in building projects and is therefore classified in Subsector 238, Specialty Trade Contractors.\n\nConstruction projects involving water resources (e.g., dredging and land drainage) and projects involving open space improvement (e.g., parks and trails) are included in this subsector.

        "description": "The Sector as a Whole\n\nThe Wholesale Trade sector comprises establishments engaged in wholesaling merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise.  The merchandise described in this sector includes the outputs of agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and certain information industries, such as publishing.\n\nThe wholesaling process is an intermediate step in the distribution of merchandise.  Wholesalers are organized to sell or arrange the purchase or sale of (a) goods for resale (i.e., goods sold to other wholesalers or retailers), (b) capital or durable nonconsumer goods, and (c) raw and intermediate materials and supplies used in production.\n\nWholesalers sell merchandise to other businesses and normally operate from a warehouse or office.  These warehouses and offices are characterized by having little or no display of merchandise.  In addition, neither the design nor the location of the premises is intended to solicit walk-in traffic.  Wholesalers do not normally use advertising directed to the general public.  Customers are generally reached initially via telephone, in-person marketing, or by specialized advertising that may include Internet and other electronic means.  Follow-up orders are either vendor-initiated or client-initiated, generally based on previous sales, and typically exhibit strong ties between sellers and buyers.  In fact, transactions are often conducted between wholesalers and clients that have long-standing business relationships.\n\nThis sector comprises two main types of wholesalers: merchant wholesalers that sell goods on their own account and agents and brokers that arrange sales and purchases for others generally for a commission or fee.\n\n(1)   Establishments that sell goods on their own account are known as wholesale merchants, distributors, jobbers, drop shippers, and import/export merchants.  Also included as wholesale merchants are sales offices and sales branches (but not retail stores) maintained by manufacturing, refining, or mining enterprises apart from their plants or mines for the purpose of marketing their products, and group purchasing organizations primarily purchasing and selling goods on their own account.  Merchant wholesale establishments typically maintain their own warehouse, where they receive and handle goods for their customers.  Goods are generally sold without transformation, but may include integral functions, such as sorting, packaging, labeling, and other marketing services.\n\n(2)   Establishments arranging for the purchase or sale of goods owned by others or purchasing goods, generally on a commission basis are known as business-to-business electronic markets, agents and brokers, commission merchants, import/export agents and brokers, auction companies, group purchasing organizations (acting as agents), and manufacturers' representatives.  These establishments operate from offices and generally do not own or handle the goods they sell.\n\nSome wholesale establishments may be connected with a single manufacturer and promote and sell the particular manufacturer's products to a wide range of other wholesalers or retailers.  Other wholesalers may be connected to a retail chain, or limited number of retail chains, and only provide a variety of products needed by that particular retail operation(s).  These wholesalers may obtain the products from a wide range of manufacturers.  Still other wholesalers may not take title to the goods, but act as agents and brokers for a commission.\n\nAlthough, in general, wholesaling normally denotes sales in large volumes, durable nonconsumer goods may be sold in single units.  Sales of capital or durable nonconsumer goods used in the production of goods and services, such as farm machinery, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and industrial machinery, are always included in wholesale trade.",

        "description": "The Sector as a Whole\n\nThe Information sector comprises establishments engaged in the following processes: (a) producing and distributing information and cultural products, (b) providing the means to transmit or distribute these products as well as data or communications, and (c) processing data.\n\nThe main components of this sector are motion picture and sound recording industries; publishing industries, including software publishing; broadcasting and content providers; telecommunications industries; computing infrastructure providers, data processing, Web hosting, and related services; and Web search portals, libraries, archives, and other information services.\n\nThe unique characteristics of information and cultural products, and of the processes involved in their production and distribution, distinguish the Information sector from the goods-producing and service-producing sectors.  Some of these characteristics are:\n\n1. Unlike traditional goods, an ''information or cultural product,'' such as an online newspaper or a television program, does not necessarily have tangible qualities, nor is it necessarily associated with a particular form.  A movie can be viewed at a movie theater or through television broadcast, video-on-demand, or streaming services.  A sound recording can be aired on radio, embedded in multimedia products, streamed, or sold at a record store.\n\n2. Unlike traditional services, the delivery of these products does not require direct contact between the supplier and the consumer.\n\n3. The value of these products to the consumer lies in their informational, educational, cultural, or entertainment content, not in the format in which they are distributed.  Most of these products are protected from unlawful reproduction by copyright laws. \n\n4. The intangible property aspect of information and cultural products makes the processes involved in their production and distribution very different from goods and services.  Only those possessing the rights to these works are authorized to reproduce, alter, improve, and distribute them.  Acquiring and using these rights often involves significant costs.  In addition, technology has revolutionized the distribution of these products.  It is possible to distribute them in a physical form, via broadcast, or online.\n\n5. Distributors of information and cultural products can easily add value to the products they distribute.  For instance, broadcasters add advertising not contained in the original product.  This capacity means that unlike traditional goods distributors, they derive revenue not from sale of the distributed product to the final consumer, but from those who pay for the privilege of adding information to the original product.  Similarly, a directory and mailing list publisher can acquire the rights to thousands of previously published newspaper and periodical articles and add new value by providing search and software and organizing the information in a way that facilitates research and retrieval.  These products often command a much higher price than the original information.\n\nExcluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in custom design of software; mass reproducing software or other prerecorded audio and video material on magnetic or optical media; producing live artistic and cultural works or productions; and performing in or creating artistic and cultural works or productions as independent (i.e., freelance) individuals.",

                "description": "Industries in the Motion Picture and Sound Recording Industries subsector group establishments involved in the production and distribution of motion pictures and sound recordings.  While producers and distributors of motion pictures and sound recordings issue works for sale as traditional publishers do, the processes are sufficiently different to warrant placing establishments engaged in these activities in a separate subsector.  Production is typically a complex process that involves several distinct types of establishments that are engaged in activities, such as contracting with performers, creating the film or sound content, and providing technical postproduction services.  Film distribution is often to exhibitors, such as theaters and broadcasters, rather than through the wholesale and retail distribution chain.  When the product is in a mass-produced form, NAICS treats production and distribution as the major economic activity as it does in the Publishing Industries subsector, rather than as a subsidiary activity to the manufacture of such products.\n\nThis subsector does not include establishments primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of video and sound recordings, such as compact discs and audio tapes; these establishments are included in the Wholesale Trade sector.  Reproduction of video and sound recordings that is carried out separately from establishments engaged in production and distribution is treated in NAICS as a manufacturing activity.  Establishments that primarily acquire the rights to distribute video and sound recordings to the public via television or radio broadcast or streaming distribution services are classified in Subsector 516, Broadcasting and Content Providers.  Establishments using facilities and infrastructure that they operate to distribute cable and satellite television subscription programming are included in Subsector 517, Telecommunications.",

In general, establishments known as publishers issue copies of works for which they usually possess copyright.  Works may be in one or more formats including print form, CD-ROM, proprietary electronic networks, or exclusively on the Internet.  Publishers may publish works originally created by others for which they have obtained the rights and/or works that they have created in-house.  Publishers may publish only and license rights to others to distribute their content, or they may publish and distribute content they create or own.  Software publishing is included here because the activity, creation of a copyrighted product and bringing it to market, is equivalent to the creation process for other types of intellectual products.\n\nIn NAICS, publishing--the reporting, writing, editing, and other processes that are required to create an edition of a newspaper, for example--is treated as a major economic activity in its own right, rather than as a subsidiary activity to a manufacturing activity, printing.  Thus, publishing is classified in the Information sector; whereas, printing is in the Manufacturing sector.  The Publishing Industries subsector excludes printed products, such as manifold business forms and appointment books, for which information is not the essential component.  Establishments producing these items are included in Subsector 323, Printing and Related Support Activities.\n\nReproduction of prepackaged software is treated in NAICS as a manufacturing activity, and custom design of software to client specifications is included in the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services sector.  These distinctions arise because of the different ways that software is created, reproduced, and distributed.\n\nMusic publishers and establishments primarily engaged in the production, or production and distribution, of motion pictures and sound recordings are included in Subsector 512, Motion Picture and Sound Recording Industries.  Establishments not engaged in publishing and exclusively obtaining rights from publishers to broadcast and distribute content are included in Subsector 516, Broadcasting and Content Providers.",

        "title": "Finance and InsuranceT",
        "description": "The Sector as a Whole\n\nThe Finance and Insurance sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in financial transactions (transactions involving the creation, liquidation, or change in ownership of financial assets) and/or in facilitating financial transactions.  Three principal types of activities are identified:\n\n1.  Raising funds by taking deposits and/or issuing securities and, in the process, incurring liabilities.  Establishments engaged in this activity use raised funds to acquire financial assets by making loans and/or purchasing securities.  Putting themselves at risk, they channel funds from lenders to borrowers and transform or repackage the funds with respect to maturity, scale, and risk.  This activity is known as financial intermediation.\n\n2.  Pooling of risk by underwriting insurance and annuities.  Establishments engaged in this activity collect fees, insurance premiums, or annuity considerations; build up reserves; invest those reserves; and make contractual payments.  Fees are based on the expected incidence of the insured risk and the expected return on investment.\n\n3.  Providing specialized services facilitating or supporting financial intermediation, insurance, and employee benefit programs.\n\nIn addition, monetary authorities charged with monetary control are included in this sector.\n\nThe subsectors, industry groups, and industries within the Finance and Insurance sector are defined on the basis of their unique production processes.  As with all industries, the production processes are distinguished by their use of specialized human resources and specialized physical capital.  In addition, the way in which these establishments acquire and allocate financial capital, their source of funds, and the use of those funds provides a third basis for distinguishing characteristics of the production process.  For instance, the production process in raising funds through deposit-taking is different from the process of raising funds in bond or money markets.  The process of making loans to individuals also requires different production processes than does the creation of investment pools or the underwriting of securities.\n\nMost of the Finance and Insurance subsectors contain one or more industry groups of (1) intermediaries with similar patterns of raising and using funds and (2) establishments engaged in activities that facilitate, or are otherwise related to, that type of financial or insurance intermediation.  Industries within this sector are defined in terms of activities for which a production process can be specified, and many of these activities are not exclusive to a particular type of financial institution.  To deal with the varied activities taking place within existing financial institutions, the approach is to split these institutions into components performing specialized services.  This requires defining the units engaged in providing those services and developing procedures that allow for their delineation.  These units are the equivalents for finance and insurance of the establishments defined for other industries.\n\nThe output of many financial services, as well as the inputs and the processes by which they are combined, cannot be observed at a single location and can only be defined at a higher level of the organizational structure of the enterprise.  Additionally, a number of independent activities that represent separate and distinct production processes may take place at a single location belonging to a multilocation financial firm.  Activities are more likely to be homogeneous with respect to production characteristics than are locations, at least in financial services.  The classification defines activities broadly enough that it can be used both by those classifying by location and by those employing a more top-down approach to the delineation of the establishment.\n\nEstablishments engaged in activities that facilitate, or are otherwise related to, the various types of intermediation are included in multiple subsectors, rather than in a separate subsector dedicated to services alone, because these services are performed by intermediaries, as well as by specialist establishments, and the extent to which the activity of the intermediaries can be separately identified is not clear.\n\nFinancial industries are extensive users of electronic means for facilitating the verification of financial balances, authorizing transactions, transferring funds to and from transactors' accounts, notifying banks (or credit card issuers) of the individual transactions, and providing daily summaries.  Since these transaction processing activities are integral to the production of finance and insurance services, establishments that principally provide a financial transaction processing service are classified in this sector, rather than in the data processing industry in the Information sector.\n\nLegal entities that hold portfolios of assets on behalf of others are significant and data on them are required for a variety of purposes.  Thus, for NAICS, these funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles are the fifth subsector of the Finance and Insurance sector.  These entities earn interest, dividends, and other property income, but have little or no employment and no revenue from the sale of services.  Separate establishments and employees devoted to the management of funds are classified in Industry Group 5239, Other Financial Investment Activities.",

The assets may be tangible, as is the case of real estate and equipment, or intangible, as is the case with patents and trademarks.\n\nThis sector also includes establishments primarily engaged in managing real estate for others, selling, renting, and/or buying real estate for others, and appraising real estate.  These activities are closely related to this sector's main activity, and from a production basis they are included here.  In addition, a substantial proportion of property management is self-performed by lessors.\n\nThe main components of this sector are the real estate lessors industries (including equity real estate investment trusts (REITs)); equipment lessors industries (including motor vehicles, computers, and consumer goods); and lessors of nonfinancial intangible assets (except copyrighted works).\n\nExcluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in renting or leasing equipment with operators.  Establishments renting or leasing equipment with operators are classified in various subsectors of NAICS depending on the nature of the services provided (e.g., transportation, construction, agriculture).  These activities are excluded from this sector because the client is paying for the expertise and knowledge of the equipment operator, in addition to the rental of the equipment.  In many cases, such as the rental of heavy construction equipment, the operator is essential to operate the equipment.  Also excluded from this sector are mortgage REITs and establishments primarily engaged in managing the financial portfolio assets of REITs on a fee or commission basis.  These establishments are classified in Sector 52, Finance and Insurance.",

The first type typically operates from a retail-like or storefront facility and maintains inventories of goods that are rented for short periods of time.  The latter type typically does not operate from retail-like locations or maintain inventories, and usually offers longer-term leases.  These establishments work directly with clients to enable them to acquire the use of equipment on a lease basis, or they work with equipment vendors or dealers to support the marketing of equipment to their customers under lease arrangements.  Equipment lessors generally structure lease contracts to meet the specialized needs of their clients and use their remarketing expertise to find other users for previously leased equipment.  Establishments that provide operating and capital (i.e., finance) leases are included in this subsector.\n\nEstablishments primarily engaged in leasing in combination with providing loans are classified in Sector 52, Finance and Insurance.  Establishments primarily engaged in leasing real property are classified in Subsector 531, Real Estate.  Establishments primarily engaged in renting or leasing equipment with operators are classified in various subsectors of NAICS depending on the nature of the services provided (e.g., transportation, construction, agriculture).  These activities are excluded from this subsector since the client is paying for the expertise and knowledge of the equipment operator, in addition to the rental of the equipment.  In many cases, such as the rental of heavy construction equipment, the operator is essential to operate the equipment.  Likewise, since the provision of crop harvesting services includes both the equipment and operator, it is included in Subsector 115, Support Activities for Agriculture and Forestry.  The rental or leasing of copyrighted works is classified in Sector 51, Information, and the rental or leasing of nonfinancial intangible assets, such as patents, trademarks, and/or licensing agreements, is classified in Subsector 533, Lessors of Nonfinancial Intangible Assets (except Copyrighted Works).",

These essential activities are often undertaken in-house by establishments in many sectors of the economy.  The establishments in this sector specialize in one or more of these support activities and provide these services to clients in a variety of industries and, in some cases, to households.  Activities performed include: office administration, hiring and placing of personnel, document preparation and similar clerical services, solicitation, collection, security and surveillance services, cleaning, and waste disposal services.\n\nThe administrative and management activities performed by establishments in this sector are typically on a contract or fee basis.  These activities may also be performed by establishments that are part of the company or enterprise.  However, establishments involved in administering, overseeing, and managing other establishments of the company or enterprise are classified in Sector 55, Management of Companies and Enterprises.  Establishments in Sector 55, Management of Companies and Enterprises, normally undertake the strategic and organizational planning and decision-making role of the company or enterprise.

The processes employed in this sector (e.g., general management, personnel administration, clerical activities, cleaning activities) are often integral parts of the activities of establishments found in all sectors of the economy.  The establishments classified in this subsector have specialization in one or more of these activities and can, therefore, provide services to clients in a variety of industries and, in some cases, to households.  The individual industries of this subsector are defined on the basis of the particular process that they are engaged in and the particular services they provide.\n\nMany of the activities in this subsector are ongoing routine support functions that businesses and organizations perform in-house.  However, it is common to contract or purchase services from businesses that specialize in such activities and can, therefore, provide the services more efficiently.\n\nThe industries in this subsector cannot be viewed as strictly \"support.\"  The Travel Arrangement and Reservation Services industry group includes travel agents, tour operators, and providers of other travel arrangement services, such as hotel and restaurant reservations and arranging the purchase of tickets, serving many types of clients, including individual consumers.  This group was placed in this subsector because the services are often of the \"support\" nature (e.g., travel arrangement) to businesses and other organizations that purchase such services.\n\nThe administrative and management activities performed by establishments in this sector are typically on a contract or fee basis.

        "description": "The Sector as a Whole\n\nThe Health Care and Social Assistance sector comprises establishments providing health care and social assistance for individuals.  The sector includes both health care and social assistance because it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the boundaries of these two activities.  The industries in this sector are arranged on a continuum starting with establishments providing medical care exclusively, continuing with those providing health care and social assistance, and finally finishing with those providing only social assistance.  Establishments in this sector deliver services by trained professionals.  All industries in the sector share this commonality of process, namely, labor inputs of health practitioners or social workers with the requisite expertise.  Many of the industries in the sector are defined based on the educational degree held by the practitioners included in the industry.\n\nExcluded from this sector are yoga and aerobics instruction in Subsector 611, Educational Services, physical fitness facilities in Subsector 713, Amusement, Gambling, and Recreation Industries, and personal fitness training services and non-medical diet and weight reducing centers in Subsector 812, Personal and Laundry Services.  Although these can be viewed as health services, these services are not typically delivered by health practitioners.",

                "description": "Industries in the Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector group establishments that produce or organize and promote live presentations involving the performances of actors and actresses, singers, dancers, musical groups and artists, athletes, and other entertainers, including independent (i.e., freelance) entertainers and the establishments that manage their careers.  The classification recognizes four basic processes: (1) producing (i.e., presenting) events; (2) organizing, managing, and/or promoting events; (3) managing and representing entertainers; and (4) providing the artistic, creative, and technical skills necessary to the production of these live events.  Also, this subsector contains four industries for performing arts companies.  Each is defined on the basis of the particular skills of the entertainers involved in the presentations.\n\nThe industry structure for this subsector makes a clear distinction between performing arts companies and performing artists (i.e., independent or freelance).  Although not unique to arts and entertainment, freelancing is a particularly important phenomenon in this Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector.  Distinguishing this activity from the production activity is a meaningful process differentiation.  This approach, however, is difficult to implement in the case of musical groups (i.e., companies) and artists.  These establishments tend to be more loosely organized and it can be difficult to distinguish companies from freelancers.  For this reason, NAICS includes one industry that covers both musical groups and musical artists.\n\nThis subsector contains two industries for Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events, one for those that operate facilities and another for those that do not.  This is because there are significant differences in cost structures between those promoters that manage and provide the staff to operate facilities and those that do not.  In addition to promoters without facilities, other industries in this subsector include establishments that may operate without permanent facilities.  These types of establishments include performing arts companies; musical groups and artists; spectator sports; and independent (i.e., freelance) artists, writers, and performers.\n\nExcluded from this subsector are nightclubs.  Some nightclubs promote live entertainment on a regular basis and it can be argued that they could be classified in Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events.  However, since most of these establishments function as any other drinking place when they do not promote entertainment and because most of their revenue is derived from sale of food and beverages, they are classified in Subsector 722, Food Services and Drinking Places.",

Other sectors of NAICS also provide recreational services.  Providers of recreational services are often engaged in processes classified in other sectors of NAICS.  For example, operators of resorts and hunting and fishing camps provide both accommodation and recreational facilities and services.  These establishments are classified in Subsector 721, Accommodation, partly to reflect the significant costs associated with the provision of accommodation services and partly to ensure consistency with international standards.  Likewise, establishments using transportation equipment to provide recreational and entertainment services, such as those operating sightseeing buses, dinner cruises, or helicopter rides, are classified in Subsector 487, Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation.\n\nThe industry groups in this subsector highlight particular types of activities: amusement parks and arcades, gambling industries, and other amusement and recreation industries.  The groups, however, are not all-inclusive of the activity.  The Gambling Industries industry group does not provide for full coverage of gambling activities.  For example, casino hotels are classified in Subsector 721, Accommodation; and horse and dog racing tracks without casinos are classified in Industry Group 7112, Spectator Sports.",

There is a wide range of establishments in these industries.  Some provide lodging only, while others provide meals, laundry services, and recreational facilities, as well as lodging.  Lodging establishments are classified in this subsector even if the provision of complementary services generates more revenue.  The types of complementary services provided vary from establishment to establishment.\n\nThe subsector is organized into three groups: (1) traveler accommodation, (2) recreational accommodation, and (3) rooming and boarding houses, dormitories, and workers' camps.  The Traveler Accommodation industry group includes establishments that primarily provide traditional types of lodging services.  This group includes hotels, motels, and bed-and-breakfast inns.  In addition to lodging, these establishments may provide a range of other services to their guests.  The RV (Recreational Vehicle) Parks and Recreational Camps industry group includes establishments that operate lodging facilities primarily designed to accommodate outdoor enthusiasts.  Included are travel trailer campsites, recreational vehicle parks, and outdoor adventure retreats.  The Rooming and Boarding Houses, Dormitories, and Workers' Camps industry group includes establishments providing temporary or longer-term accommodations, that for the period of occupancy, may serve as a principal residence.  Board (i.e., meals) may be provided but is not essential.\n\nEstablishments that manage short-stay accommodation establishments (e.g., hotels and motels) on a contractual basis are classified in this subsector if they both manage the operation and provide the operating staff.  Such establishments are classified based on the type of facility managed and operated.",

                "description": "Industries in the Repair and Maintenance subsector restore machinery, equipment, and other products to working order.  These establishments also typically provide general or routine maintenance (i.e., servicing) on such products to ensure they work efficiently and to prevent breakdown and unnecessary repairs.\n\nThe NAICS structure for this subsector brings together most types of repair and maintenance establishments and categorizes them based on production processes (i.e., on the type of repair and maintenance activity performed, and the necessary skills, expertise, and processes that are found in different repair and maintenance establishments).  This NAICS classification does not delineate between repair services provided to businesses versus those that serve households.  Although some industries primarily serve either businesses or households, separation by class of customer is limited by the fact that many establishments serve both.  Establishments repairing computers and consumer electronics products are two examples of such overlap.\n\nThe Repair and Maintenance subsector does not include all establishments that do repair and maintenance.  For example, a substantial amount of repair is done by establishments that also manufacture machinery, equipment, and other goods.  These establishments are included in the Manufacturing sector in NAICS.  In addition, repair of transportation equipment is often provided by or based at transportation facilities, such as airports and seaports, and these activities are included in the Transportation and Warehousing sector.  A particularly unique situation exists with repair of buildings.  Plumbing, electrical installation and repair, painting and decorating, and other construction-related establishments are often involved in performing installation or other work on new construction as well as providing repair services on existing structures.  While some specialize in repair, it is difficult to distinguish between the two types and all are included in the Construction sector.\n\nExcluded from this subsector are establishments primarily engaged in rebuilding or remanufacturing machinery and equipment.  These are classified in Sector 31-33, Manufacturing.  Also excluded are retail establishments that provide after-sale services and repair.  These are classified in Sector 44-45, Retail Trade.",

These agencies also set policy, create laws, adjudicate civil and criminal legal cases, and provide for public safety and for national defense.  In general, government establishments in the Public Administration sector oversee governmental programs and activities that are not performed by private establishments.  Establishments in this sector typically are engaged in the organization and financing of the production of public goods and services, most of which are provided for free or at prices that are not economically significant.\n\nGovernment establishments also engage in a wide range of productive activities covering not only public goods and services but also individual goods and services similar to those produced in sectors typically identified with private-sector establishments.  In general, ownership is not a criterion for classification in NAICS.  Therefore, government establishments engaged in the production of private-sector-like goods and services should be classified in the same industry as private-sector establishments engaged in similar activities.\n\nAs a practical matter, it is difficult to identify separate establishment detail for many government agencies.  To the extent that separate establishment records are available, the administration of governmental programs is classified in Sector 92, Public Administration, while the operation of governmental programs is classified elsewhere in NAICS based on the activities performed.  For example, the governmental administrative authority for an airport is classified in Industry 92612, Regulation and Administration of Transportation Programs, while operating the airport is classified in Industry 48811, Airport Operations.  When separate records for multi-establishment companies are not available to distinguish between the administration of a governmental program and the operation of it, the establishment is classified in Sector 92, Public Administration.\n\nExamples of government-provided goods and services that are classified in sectors other than Public Administration include: schools, classified in Sector 61, Educational Services; health care facilities, classified in Sector 62, Health Care and Social Assistance; establishments operating transportation facilities, classified in Sector 48-49, Transportation and Warehousing; the operation of utilities, classified in Sector 22, Utilities; and the Government Printing Office, classified in Subsector 323, Printing and Related Support Activities.",
